## **C Programming Practice**
## _String Related Problem_


### 1. Write a program in C to input a string and print it

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){

    char str[100];
    printf("Input the string: ");
    gets(str);
    printf("The string you entered is: %s ",str);
return 0;
}
```

### 2. Write a program in C to find the length of a string without using library function

```c
#include <stdio.h>
void main(){
    char str[50];
    int i=0,j=0,size=0;
    printf("Enter your string: ");
    gets(str);

    while(str[i]!='\0'){
        size++;
        i++;
    }
printf("The size of the string is :%d \n",i);

return 0;
}


```

### 3. Write a program in C to separate the individual characters from a string

```c
#include <stdio.h>
void main(){
    char str[50];
    int i=0,j=0,size=0;
    printf("Enter your string: ");
    gets(str);

printf("The characters of the string are : \n");

        while(str[j] != '\0'){
            printf("%c ",str[j]);
            j++;
        }

return 0;
}

```

### 4. Write a program in C to print individual characters of string in reverse order

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
int i=0,size=0;
char name[50];

printf("Enter the string:");
gets(name);

while(name[i]!='\0'){
    size++;
    i++;
}
printf("Reverse string is: ");
for(i=size;i>=0;i--){
    printf(" %c",name[i]);
}

}
